# Data
[Facebook](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html) <br />
# How to run
1) Learn embeddings using [Deepwalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk), [node2vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec) or [HARP](https://github.com/GTmac/HARP) <br />
2) Generate train and test pairs of nodes by generate_train_test.py <br />
3) Run feedforward.py or siamese.py to predict the shortest path between nodes<br />
